        <p>
          The <a href="senary-clock/senaryClock.html">Senary Clock</a> I made was
          inspired by a <a href = "https://bcd.nootch.net/binary">binary clock</a>
          I saw online and I wanted to do something similar. I went with a senary
          (base 6) clock because 6 was divisible by 60 (seconds/minutes), 12, and
          24 (hours).
        </p>
        <p>
          The animation for this clock relies on erasing and redrawing the hands once
          every 10 ms. Their outer and inner position are calculated via sine and cosine
          functions.
        </p>

      <article id="synthwaveSVG">
        <span>Synthwave<br />SVG</span>
        <p>
          I made the <a href="senary-clock/senaryClockSVG.html">SVG version</a> because
          I wasn't satisfied with the lack of responsiveness in the original. I wanted
          a clock that would change size based on the vertical size of the window
          so I remade my original clock with SVG elements. I also refined the style
          of it so it looks better.
        </p>
        <p>
          This clock was animated by making tiny rotational adjustments to the hands
          every 10 ms. The drawback to this technique was that if I added shadows
          to the hands, they would rotate along with the hand, causing them to cast
          in the wrong direction. The solution was to create a second set of hands
          and offset them and make them appear like shadows.

        <p>
          The <a href="mars-clock/martianClockSVG.html">Martian Clock</a> was inspired
          by my friend who quiped that I should make a clock that tells the time
          on Mars. This turned into a big research project that taught me a lot about
          different time measurements for different purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I followed the same methodology as NASA to make this clock, dividing the
          24 hours, 37 minutes, and 22 seconds of the Martian rotation period into
          24 equal periods for hours, 1,440 equal periods for minutes, 86,400 for
          seconds, and 86,400,000 for milliseconds. So you'll notice that the second
          hand runs just a bit slower than the ones on our terrestrial clocks.

        <p>
          After researching clocks for weeks it's inevitable that I would come across
          the short lived <a href="metric-clock/metricClockSVG.html">Metric Clock</a>.
          It has been proposed a few times throughout history and was briefly implemented
          during the French Revolution. Unfortunately for metric time, the inertia
          of 100s of years of sexagesimal time prevails to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The challenge for this clock was in how to derive the units of time. With
          a traditional clock made with JavaScript, one typically works from smaller
          units to larger units since the Date object returns units of time in sexagesimal
          units. With decimal time, I had to start with the 86,400,000 ms in a day,
          and begin subdividing downward.

        <span>Spin<br />Clock</span>
        <p>
          I made the <a href="spin-clock/spinClock.html">Spin Clock</a> because of
          a random flash of inspiration. I wanted to make a clock that used transforms
          to have the time rotate away behind itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The math behind this clock was a lot simpler because I only had to keep
          track of the current time and update every second. I still check the time
          every 10 ms but I only have to update the page every second. The animations
          were handled by the transition property in the CSS and clever use of timing
          using JavaScript.

      <article id="twistClock">
        <span>Twist<br />Clock</span>
        <p>
          The <a href="twist-clock/twistClock.html">Twist Clock</a> came about because
          I wanted to push what I could do with rotations. I liked the aesthetics
          of the Spin Clock but I wanted to put a different spin on the idea with a
          rotating "dial" of current, upcoming, and past seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tricky part to this clock was getting all of the elements to move properly
          and update after every second. It was 2 parts planning to 1 part trial
          and error. Another difficulty was giving everything absolute positioning
          while still making it responsive to the window size.

        <p>
          In 1998 Swatch announced their version of decimal time with
          <a href="swatch-clock/swatchTime.html">Swatch Internet Time</a>, or .beat
          time. The idea is the day is divided into 1,000 equal parts called ".beats".
          There are no time zones in .beat time, instead it's based on the time zone
          in Biel, Switzerland where Swatch headquarters is located. Swatch Internet
          Time is prefixed with an "@" followed by 3 digit fractional part of 1,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time is fairly easy to render given the tools of the JavaScript Date
          object and the application of a bit of math. The hardest part for me was
          finding a way to display a variable-width font as if it were monospaced.

        <span>Neon Pixel<br />Clock</span>
        <p>
          I originally wanted to make a clock with 7-segment digit display but I opted
          to tackle the slightly easier task of a <a href="neon-pixel-1/neonPixel1.html">
          15-pixel digit clock</a> instead. I saw an image of something similar online
          and I wanted to try to recreate it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used a 2-dimensional array to define the pixels for each digit and made
          a function to translate that into HTML and CSS. To get the pixels to sort
          themselves properly I used a grid layout. To get the digits to fit nicely
          in their container I used a flex layout.
