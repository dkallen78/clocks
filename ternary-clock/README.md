# [Ternary Clock](https://dkallen78.github.io/clocks/ternary-clock/ternary-clock.html)

This clock was inspired by a conversation I had with someone on Reddit.

The basic idea is a a clock built around base 3 so the fundamental division of the day is into three parts. In my code I call these parts "terns" but if someone has something better, I'll use that instead. Each tern is divided into 9 hours; each hour into 27 minutes, and each minute into 81 seconds. This makes the hour<sub>3</sub> 89% shorter than the hour<sub>60</sub>, the minute<sub>3</sub> 97% longer than the minute<sub>60</sub>, and the  second<sub>3</sub> 46% longer than the  second<sub>60</sub>
