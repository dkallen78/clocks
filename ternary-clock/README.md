# [Ternary Clock](https://dkallen78.github.io/clocks/ternary-clock/ternary-clock.html)

This clock was inspired by a conversation I had with someone on Reddit.

The basic idea is a a clock built around base 3 so the fundamental division of the day is into three parts. In my code I call these parts "terns" but if someone has something better, I'll use that instead. Each tern is divided into 9 hours; each hour into 27 minutes, and each minute into 81 seconds. This makes the ternary hour 89% shorter than the sexagesimal hour, the ternary minute 97% longer than the sexagesimal minute, and the ternary second<sub>3</sub> 46% longer than the sexagesimal second<sub>60</sub>
