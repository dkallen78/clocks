#[Swatch Beat Clock](https://dkallen78.github.io/clocks/swatch-clock/swatchTime.html)

I discovered Swatch time by accident while working on another clock and decided I had to make it. Swatch divides the day into 1,000 equal parts called Beats which come out to be 86.4 seconds each. In addition to displaying the current Beat, I also display the hundredth part of the current beat. The math to pull this off is pretty simple: I get the number of milliseconds that have ellapsed so far in the day and divide by 86,400. The quotient is the current Beat. 

The tricky part for this particular clock was using the bespoke Swatch font which involved using the `@font-face` at-rule to make sure the font was visible on all browsers even if the user hadn't downloaded it; and doing some shenanigans with the CSS and HTML to make sure it behaved as a monospaced font.
